# :airplane: Tripper
Tripper is an interactive scratch map that allows users to keep track of their travels.

✅ Users can add countries to their map and mark them as 'visited' or 'want to visit'.  
✅ Users can update or delete existing countries from their map.  
✅ Users can read general information about each country (continent, capital, language, and population).  
✅ Users can share their scratch maps with friends and family.  
✅ The app is fully responsive and it adapts to any screen size.

## My Process
I developed the project over the course of three weeks. In order to learn and develop my skills, it was important for me to not use a lot of external packages and to implement certain features from scratch, for example, an accessible autocomplete input and accessible tabs.

### Tools
After designing a prototype of the application using Adobe XD, I started developing the app using the following technologies:
* React (Custom hooks & Context API)
* React Router 6
* React Query
* React Leaflet (GeoJSON)
* Styled Components
* Framer Motion
* Firebase authentication services & Firestore database  

In order to obtain information about the countries, I used the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).
